Naming Conventions:
==================
(1) Data types are in lower cases.
(2) Enums, Macros and constant defines are upper or camel case.
(3) Function are named after their parent module: <module name>_<func name>.



Matrix Storage Schemes:
======================

(1) Row major format: 
    Row entries are adjacent in memory. Let M be a matrix and pM be the
    pointer to M. Then
        M[i][j] = pM[ i + j*row ];  i -> 0 to (row-1), j -> 0 to (col-1)

(2) Column major format: 
    Column entries are adjacent in memory. Let M be a matrix and pM be the
    pointer to M. Then
        M[i][j] = pM[ i*col + j ];  i -> 0 to (row-1), j -> 0 to (col-1)

MATLAB uses column major storage formats while C uses row major format.
